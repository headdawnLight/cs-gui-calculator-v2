# cs-gui-calculator-v2

This is a simple calculator program running in a graphical user interface. It was developed on Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 .Net Framework 4.7.2 platform with C# programming language.

## Introduction

A gui (graphical user interface) is a system of interactive visual components for computer software. A gui displays objects that convey information, and represent actions that can be taken by the user. 
The objects change color, size, or visibility when the user interacts with them.

[cs-gui-calculator](https://github.com/headdawnLight/cs-gui-calculator.git) was able to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*) and division(/)).

[cs-gui-calculator-v2](https://github.com/headdawnLight/cs-gui-calculator-v2.git) can perform mathematical operations such as factorial, square root, exponent, logarithm.

In summary, in the previous version we were able to perform:

Arithmetic Operations:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

In this new version, we can perform:

- Arithmetic calculation
- Factorial calculation
- Square root calculation
- Calculating the squares of 2
- Calculating base 10 logarithms

Technology and tools I used while developing this program:

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2019
- .Net Framework 4.7.2
- C#
- Git
- GitHub

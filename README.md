# cs-gui-calculator-v2

This is a simple calculator program running in a graphical user interface. It was developed on Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 .Net Framework 4.7.2 platform with C# programming language.

## Introduction

A gui (graphical user interface) is a system of interactive visual components for computer software. A gui displays objects that convey information, and represent actions that can be taken by the user. 
The objects change color, size, or visibility when the user interacts with them.

An element receives a click event when a pointing device button (such as a mouse's primary mouse button) is both pressed and released while the pointer is located inside the element.

KeyboardEvent objects describe a user interaction with the keyboard; each event describes a single interaction between the user and a key (or combination of a key with modifier keys) on the keyboard. The event type ( keydown , keypress , or keyup ) identifies what kind of keyboard activity occurred.

[cs-gui-calculator](https://github.com/headdawnLight/cs-gui-calculator.git) was able to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*) and division(/)). Also, only click event functions were available in this version. It was not possible to use the program only with the keyboard.

[cs-gui-calculator-v2](https://github.com/headdawnLight/cs-gui-calculator-v2.git) can perform mathematical operations such as factorial, square root, exponent, logarithm. Also, keypress events are available in this version in addition to the click event functions. It is possible to use the program only through the keyboard.

In summary, in the previous version we were able to perform:

Arithmetic Operations:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

In this new version, we can perform:

- Arithmetic calculation
- Factorial calculation
- Square root calculation
- Calculating the squares of 2
- Calculating base 10 logarithms

Technology and tools I used while developing this program:

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2019
- .Net Framework 4.7.2
- C#
- Git
- GitHub

## Installation
